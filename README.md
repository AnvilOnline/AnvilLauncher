# AnvilLauncher
The one-click solution for downloading and installing updates.

## Building
In order to build the AnvilLauncher project you will need Visual Studio 2015, or the 2015 Build Tools.
This is due to the use of .Net 4.6 and C# 6.0

## Configuration
When the final executable is built you can ship with the AnvilLauncher.exe.config file that will allow users to configure their settings (ex. skipping updates and just launching, good for developers)
